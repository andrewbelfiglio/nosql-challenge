# nosql-challenge

### This project is an assignment in the Data Science and Data Visualizations bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

### This repository contains the two .ipynb files that prepare and analyze the establishments.json file (which is located in the Resources folder). The establishments.json file contains data of food establishments in the United Kingdom, such as the location and the ratings from the UK Food Standards Agency.

### The setup ipynb file prepares the data by importing it into MongoDB, inserting a new restaurant, and updating some data and data types. The analysis ipynb file performs an exploratory analysis, assessing various questions that are of interest to editors of a food magazine.

### This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program.
